# Polypropylene
A good alternative to cardstock for when you need to cut a thin, durable, coloured piece out for a project.

This is relatively safe, as long as you are sure you have the right material.

## Safety
- Make sure the material you grab is laser safe and is not PVC (polyvinyl chloride)!
- Ensure you are paying attention to this one as it can catch fire if heated up too much!

## Speeds and Feeds
- Tape it onto a backing piece so it can't get blown away by the air assist.
