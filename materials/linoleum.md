# Linoleum
Linoleum, or lino, is useful for making stamps and prints.

It leaves a burnt rubber smell after cutting which isn't the nicest.

I do not recommend cutting this material until you are really familiar with your laser (and have spoken to other people if you share it)

## Safety
Make sure the material you grab is laser safe and is not PVC (polyvinyl chloride)!

## Speeds and Feeds

- Tape the material before cutting to prevent burnt material from sticking back to it
- Use the material from the bottom to keep most of the burnt bits off of it
