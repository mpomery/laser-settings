# Laser Materials Database

## What Is This?
My notes for the settings for etching and cutting materials on a laser cutter, what the cut ends up as, and notes on finishing the pieces you cut out.

All of these settings are from the 100-ish Watt CO2 Laser at Robots and Dinosaurs.

## General Laser Safety
[Insert something here about being safe with lasers, ensuring materials are laser safe, and staying attentive incase something you don't want to catch on fire catches on fire as you are cutting by burning]
